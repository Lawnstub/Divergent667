# Divergent667
An open source 667 base.

Main features:
 - Quest system -- example quest Druidic ritual
 - Rewritten dialogue system for convinient dialogue writing
 - Action registeration system that lets you register actions from anywhere in your code.
 Actions include object actions, npc actions, player actions and command actions
 - Construction (pathing in a POH is broken and some rotations don't save correctly otherwise quite functional)
 - Server sided path correction (might be related to the above. It's more likely though that the objects are added in a way that the pathfinding doesn't recognize)
 -  An effect system
